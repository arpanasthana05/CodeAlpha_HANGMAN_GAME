## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly Python implementation of the classic **Hangman** word game.  
The program randomly selects a word from a small predefined list, and the player guesses it letter by letter.  
Each incorrect guess reduces the available chances. The game ends when the word is correctly guessed or all attempts are used.
